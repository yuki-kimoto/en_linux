<h2> Setting environment variables for bash </ h2>

To set environment variables in bash, use the following environment variable setting syntax.

<pre>
export environment variable name = value
</ pre>

This is a sample to set environment variables. I set Perl's <a href="https://perlzemi.com/blog/20200617111016.html"> PERL5LIB environment variable </a>.

<pre>
export PERL5LIB = / foo / lib
</ pre>

<h3> What does export mean? </ H3>

If you use export, the environment variables will be inherited by the program to be executed.

If not used, environment variables are valid only within that shell.

Generally, environment variables are referenced by the program to be executed, so it is common to add export.
