<h2> mv Command - Rename Files </h2>

You can change the file name using the mv command. The original file name is changed to the new file name. The name of mv comes from move.

<pre>
mv OriginalFileName NewFileName
</pre>

This is a sample to change the file name with the mv command. The file name foo.txt is renamed to bar.txt.

<pre>
mv foo.txt bar.txt
</pre>

<h3> Rename the directory </h3>

The mv command can also be used to rename a directory. On Linux, file names and directory names are treated the same. A directory is a folder in Windows.

<pre>
mv OriginalDirectoryName NewDirectoryName
</pre>

This is a sample to change the directory name. The directory name dir1 is changed to the directory name dir2.

<pre>
mv dir1 dir2
</pre>

<h3> Move the file location </h3>

The mv command can also be used to move the location of a file.

Let's move foo.txt in the directory called labo in the home directory to the directory called test in the home directory. "~" Represents the path of your home directory.

<pre>
mv ~/labo/foo.txt ~/test/foo.txt
</pre>

As mentioned above, the mv command is also used when moving files.

If you want to move the file, you can omit only the last file name. Notice the trailing slash.

<pre>
# Syntack sugar of the above operation
mv ~/labo/foo.txt ~/test/
</pre>

You can do the same if you want to move the directory location.

<pre>
mv ~/labo/dir1 ~/test/dir1
</pre>

or

<pre>
# Syntack sugar of the above operation
mv ~/labo/dir1 ~/test/
</pre>

<h3> Show help --help option </h3>

Use the "--help" option to get help.

<pre>
mv --help
</pre>

Help is displayed.
