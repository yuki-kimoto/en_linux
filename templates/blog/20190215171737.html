<h2> Specify the port number with Tera Term macro </h2>



SSH connection port is 22 by default, but it is often changed to improve security. To specify the port number in the Tera Term macro, use a colon as shown below.

<pre>
# DomainNameOrIPAddress:PortNumber </h3>
5.34.206.140:49251
</pre>

The following is a setting example.

<pre>
connect '5.34.206.140:49251 /ssh /2 /auth=password /user=kimoto /passwd=henohenomoheji'
</pre>
