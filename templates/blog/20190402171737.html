<h2> Let's learn the basic commands of Linux Part 1 </h2>



When working on Linux, remembering useful commands will make the work more efficient. Here are some useful commands.

<h3> Show the path of the current directory </h3>

The current directory is the directory you are currently working on. You can use the <b> pwd </b> command to display the path of the current directory.

<pre>
pwd
</pre>
The path of the current directory is displayed as shown below.
<pre>
/home/kimoto
</pre>

<h3> Change current directory </h3>

Use the <b> cd </b> command to move the current directory.
<pre>
cd DirectoryName
</pre>
The directory name can be either a relative path relative to the current directory or an absolute path that describes the complete path.

For example, if you are working in the current directory "/home/kimoto" and want to move to the directory "labo" directly under this, do as follows.

<pre>
cd labo
</pre>

You can also move by specifying the absolute path.

<pre>
cd /home/kimoto/labo
</pre>

<h4> Abbreviated notation of home directory </h4>

Here are some techniques for the cd command. You can use the directory name "~" to move to the user's home directory.

<pre>
cd ~
</pre>

If the user is kimoto, it has the same meaning as the following specification.

<pre>
cd /home/kimoto
</pre>

<h4> Specify easily using wildcards </h4>

Actually, when moving with cd, if you use wildcards, you do not need to specify all the names of the directory name.

<pre>
cd la*
</pre>

<B> * </b> is a wildcard, and if you specify "la*", you can move to the directory "labo" if it exists. Typing or copying and pasting all names is a useful technique when you're having trouble.

<h3> Display the list of files contained in the directory </h3>

Use the <b> ls </b> command to display the list of files contained in the directory (including the directory).

<pre>
ls
</pre>
A list of files will be displayed as shown below.
<pre>
README lib script
</pre>

<h4> See details </h4>

Use the <b> l </b> option to include information such as file permissions and file size.

<pre>
ls -l
</pre>
You can see the detailed information of the file as follows.
<pre>
-rw-rw-r-- 1 kimoto kimoto 588  June 16 13:19 README
drwxrwxr-x 3 kimoto kimoto 4096 June 16 16:39 lib
drwxrwxr-x 2 kimoto kimoto 4096 June 25 19:21 script
</pre>

The permission setting is on the far left. Permissions are the permissions on a file. I would like to introduce the idea later in this series.

<h4> See hidden files </h4>

The ls command does not display hidden files starting with. (Dot) by default. Use the <b> a </b> option to display hidden files.

<pre>
ls -a
</pre>
By doing this, hidden files can also be displayed.

In Linux, you can specify multiple options. For example, you can specify both advanced and hidden file display options.

<pre>
ls -al
</pre>

<h4> Narrow down the files to be displayed with wildcards </h4>

You can narrow down the files to be displayed by using wildcards.

<pre>
ls 2012*
</pre>

If you specify as above, you can display only the files starting with 2012.
