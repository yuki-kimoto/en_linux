<h2> du command-check directory capacity </h2>

You can check the directory capacity with the du command. If no directory name is specified, the current directory will be the target.

<pre>
du directory name
</pre>

This is a sample to check the directory capacity with du.

<pre>

</pre>

This is a sample output result.

The capacity is displayed in kilobytes for each directory and subdirectory.

<h3> To display in an easy-to-understand manner with units </h3>

Use the "-h" option to clearly display the units of the du command.

<pre>
du -h
</pre>

The output result has a unit.

<pre>
Filesystem Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on
udev 3.9G 0 3.9G 0% / dev
tmpfs 794M 736K 793M 1% / run
/ dev / sda1 29G 4.1G 25G 15% /
tmpfs 3.9G 8.0K 3.9G 1% / dev / shm

</pre>

<h3> Arrange directory usage from top to bottom </h3>

To display the directory usage in order from the top, combine sort and head with the du command. Useful for discovering large directories.

<pre>
du templates | sort -rn | head -20
</pre>

The output results are output in descending order of directory capacity.

<pre>

Specifying "/" for du and waiting for a while is convenient because you can see which directories are consuming space on the entire system.

<h3> How to check the capacity of the disk? </H3>

Use the df command to check the capacity of the disk.

Note that the du command is a command to check the directory capacity, and the df command is used to check the disk capacity.

<ul>
  <li> <a href="/blog/20200601093211.html"> df command --check disk capacity</a> </li>
</ul>
<h2> What are permissions? </H2>

Permissions are the permissions to access a file.

Information about whether the owner, group, or other user has read, write, or execute permissions on the file.

The word file also includes directories. This is because in Linux, a directory is considered to be a type of file.

<h3> Owners, groups, and other users </h3>

A description of owners, groups, and other users.

<h4> What is the owner in permissions </h4>

The owner in a permission is the owner user of the file. You can see it at "<a href="http://59.106.185.196:3000/blog/20191126082723.html"> ls -l</a>". It is displayed in the third column.

<h4> What is a group in permissions </h4>

A group in permissions is a user who belongs to the owner group of the file. You can see it at "<a href="http://59.106.185.196:3000/blog/20191126082723.html"> ls -l</a>". It is displayed in the 4th column.

<h4> What are other users in permissions? </H4>

Other users in permissions are users other than the owner and the users who belong to the group.

<h3> Read permission, write permission, execution permission </h3>

This is an explanation of read permission, write permission, and execution permission.

<h4> What is read permission? </H4>

Read permission means that the file can be read.

<h4> What is write permission? </H4>

Read permission means that you can write to a file.

<h4> What is execution permission? </H4>

Executable means that the file can be executed as an executable file.

The directory has a special meaning, and you cannot access the directory without execute permission.

In general, give execute permission to all directories.

<h3> Representation of permissions </h3>

I will explain the expression of permissions.

First, permissions are represented by the following nine pieces of information. Remember this order.

<ol>
  <li> Owner read permission </li>
  <li> Owner write permission </li>
  <li> Owner execution permission </li>
  <li> Group read permission </li>
  <li> Group write permission </li>
  <li> Group execution permission </li>
  <li> Allow other users to read </li>
  <li> Other user write permission </li>
  <li> Execution permission of other users </li>
</ol>

<h4> String representation of permissions </h4>

When permissions are represented by a string. When viewed with the ls command, it is represented by a character string.

<pre>
drwxr-xr-x 7 admins admins 68 Apr 20 13:13 dir1
-rwxrwxr-x 1 admins admins 724 May 21 13:56 file1
</pre>

Remove the leftmost "d" and "-" parts.

<pre>
rwxr-xr-x
</pre>

It has 9 characters, but it corresponds to the 9 information explained above as it is.

r is read permission, w is write permission, and x is execution permission.

<h4> Octal representation of permissions </h4>

An octal representation of permissions. The chmod command is used to set permissions using octal numbers.

<pre>
# Octal
644
755
600
</pre>

Think of this in binary.

4 is "4 + 0 + 0". Therefore, the binary number is "100". You have read permission.

5 is "4 + 0 + 1". So if it's a binary number, it's "101". There are read permission and execution permission.

6 is "4 + 2 + 0". Therefore, the binary number is "110". There are read permission and write permission.

7 is "4 + 2 + 1". So if it's a binary number, it's "111". There are read permission, write permission, and execute permission.

0 is "0 + 0 + 0". So the binary number is "000". You do not have permission.

This corresponds to nine pieces of information. Where 1 stands, there is a permit.

<pre>
# Binary number
110 100 100
111 101 101
110 000 000
</pre>

For clarity, we've put a space between the owner's permissions, the group's permissions, and other user permissions.
