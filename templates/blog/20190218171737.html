<h3> Undo changes made to the index </ h3>

You used the add command to update the index to commit, but you may want to undo the changes you made to the index. In such cases, use the reset command.

<pre>
git reset
</ pre>

This will undo the changes you made to the index. If you check it with the diff command, you can see that the index state is restored and the difference from the working tree is displayed.

<pre>
git diff
</ pre>
